## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of Python practicals covering fundamental and intermediate concepts. Each practical includes a problem statement, a solution (usually in a Python file), and sometimes an explanation of the code.  These practicals are suitable for beginners and those looking to reinforce their Python skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  It's recommended to use Python 3.x.
